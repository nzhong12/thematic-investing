# PGI Theme Graphs Project

A Python research tool for analyzing evolving market themes using network graph analysis of S&P 500 stock correlations.

## Overview

This project analyzes **rolling correlations** between S&P 500 stocks using **minimum spanning trees (MST)** and **graph-based clustering** methods. It pulls daily price data from **WRDS/CRSP**, computes correlations over multiple time windows, and identifies stock clusters representing potential market themes.

**Key Features:**
- Connects to WRDS database to fetch S&P 500 constituent prices (2023-2024, ~500 days)
- Computes rolling correlations (10-day, 30-day, 50-day windows)
- Constructs minimum spanning trees to reveal stock relationships
- Implements two clustering methods:
  - **Basic correlation threshold clustering** (MST + edge filtering + connected components)
  - **Jaccard distance + hierarchical clustering** (robust to noise, captures higher-order relationships)
- Exports daily cluster assignments for ~500 trading days
- Identifies persistent vs. transient themes across time windows
- Produces cluster composition frequency analysis (top 20 pairs, triplets, etc.)
- Interactive visualizations for exploring correlation dynamics

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
2. **WRDS account** with CRSP database access (make an account)
3. **WRDS credentials** configured (see [Configuration](#configuration) below)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nzhong12/thematic-investing.git
cd thematic-investing

# Create and activate virtual environment (first time create and activate env)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies IN the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** If you restart your terminal or start a new session, always re-activate the virtual environment first:
```bash
cd thematic-investing
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate venv before running any scripts
```

### Configuration

Set up your WRDS credentials (OPTIONAL or just enter every time it prompts)

```bash
# Option 1: Environment variable (optional or enter manually)
export WRDS_USERNAME='your_wrds_username'

# Option 2: Create .pgpass file (one-time setup)
# Run this command and enter your WRDS password when prompted:
python -c "import wrds; wrds.Connection()"
```

## How to Run

### ⚠️ Important: Always Generate Fresh Data First

**Before running `extract_clusters_corr.py` and `extract_clusters_jaccard.py`**, make sure to run `sp500_rolling_correlation.py` to generate the most recent correlation, and after changing the dates in `sp500_rolling_correlation.py`, rerun it before running `extract_clusters_corr.py` :

This ensures datasets have complete 202X-2024 coverage (most recent coverage as shown in sp500 file)

### 🚀 Method 1: Complete Workflow (Recommended for First Time)

Run the full analysis pipeline to compute correlations and visualize MST:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd thematic-investing

# Activate virtual environment (if using venv)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Step 1: Download data and compute rolling correlations (ALWAYS RUN FIRST)
python scripts/sp500_rolling_correlation.py

# Step 2: Visualize the Minimum Spanning Tree
python scripts/show_mst_only.py

# Step 3 Extract clusters for all trading days
python scripts/extract_clusters_corr.py
python scripts/extract_clusters_jaccard.py

# Step 4: Analyze cluster persistence and transitions over time
python scripts/temporal_clusters.py
```

**What happens:**
1. `scripts/sp500_rolling_correlation.py`:
   - Downloads 100 largest S&P 500 stocks from WRDS CRSP (2023-2024, ~500 trading days)
   - Computes rolling correlations for 10-, 30-, and 50-day windows
   - Saves results to `correlation_data.pkl`
   - Exports CSV time series (top-10 correlation analysis commented out for speed)

2. `scripts/show_mst_only.py`:
   - Loads pre-computed correlation data from `correlation_data.pkl`
   - Builds Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) from correlation network
   - Visualizes MST with interactive graph layout (← → to change windows, ↑ ↓ to navigate dates)
   - Edge thickness/color shows correlation strength

3. `scripts/extract_clusters_corr.py`:
   - Loads `correlation_data.pkl` generated in Step 1
   - Builds MST for each date, filters by correlation ≥ 0.6 (tight sector clusters)
   - Uses basic pairwise correlation threshold method
   - Outputs daily cluster assignments to TXT files (~500 days per window)
   - Shows top 20 most frequent cluster groups with [size=X] indicators

4. `scripts/extract_clusters_jaccard.py`:
   - Loads `correlation_data.pkl` generated in Step 1
   - Computes correlation neighborhoods for each stock (G_A = {X | r_AX > 0.6})
   - Calculates Jaccard distance between neighborhoods: d(A,B) = 1 - |G_A ∩ G_B| / |G_A ∪ G_B|
   - Applies hierarchical clustering (agglomerative, average linkage, mid-level cut)
   - Merges singleton clusters into 'outliers' group
   - More robust than pairwise method, captures higher-order correlation patterns
   - Outputs daily cluster assignments to TXT files (~500 days per window)
   - Shows top 20 most frequent cluster groups with [size=X] indicators

5. `scripts/temporal_clusters.py`:
   - Implements Section 2.3 of the paper (Temporal Graph of Clusters)
   - Takes the daily Jaccard-based clusters generated in Step 4 and builds a directed, weighted temporal graph showing how clusters evolve over time
   - Loads `jaccard_clusters.pkl`, removes all singleton clusters so only meaningful multi-stock clusters remain (V′), and creates one node for each cluster on each date (with date, index, size, and member tickers)
   - Connects clusters on consecutive days whenever they share at least one stock; each directed edge from day τᵢ to τᵢ₊₁ is weighted by the intersection size |Sᵢⱼ ∩ Sᵢ₊₁ₖ|, measuring cluster persistence
   - Outputs: `temporal_nodes.csv` (all cluster nodes with metadata) and `temporal_edges.csv` (all edges with weights and shared elements), enabling downstream analysis of theme evolution and market structure stability

### Example 2: Possible Tweaks

Edit parameters in `scripts/sp500_rolling_correlation.py`:

```python
start_date = "2023-01-01"  # Current default: 2023-2024 (~500 days)
end_date = "2024-12-31"    # Use "2022-01-01" for 3 years (~750 days, ~30% slower)
num_stocks = 100           # Current default: 100 for meaningful sector clusters
                           # Note: 100 stocks = better clustering but dense visualizations
                           # Use 20-30 stocks for readable heatmaps, or use show_mst_only.py
```

Then run from project directory:
```bash
cd thematic-investing
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate venv first
python scripts/sp500_rolling_correlation.py
python scripts/show_mst_only.py
python scripts/extract_clusters_corr.py
python scripts/extract_clusters_jaccard.py
```

## Performance Optimization Options

For faster testing and development, several optimization flags are available:

**In `sp500_rolling_correlation.py`:**
```python
# Date range (line ~22-23)
start_date = "2023-01-01"  # Default: 2023-01-01 (2 years)
end_date = "2024-12-31"    # Use "2022-01-01" for 3 years (~30% slower)

# Stock count (line ~24)
num_stocks = 100            # Default: 100 for meaningful sector clusters
                            # Use 20-30 for readable heatmap visualizations
                            # Visualizations commented out by default with 100 stocks

# Optimization note: Top-10 correlation analysis and visualizations are
# commented out by default (~10-15 min savings with 100 stocks).
# Use show_mst_only.py for better visualization of stock relationships.
```

**In `extract_clusters_corr.py` and `extract_clusters_jaccard.py`:**
```python
# Skip 10-day window (line ~70)
SKIP_10DAY = True          # Default: True (saves ~33% time)
                           # Set False to include 10-day rolling window

# Date sampling for fast testing (line ~72)
DATE_SAMPLING = 1          # Default: 1 (process all dates)
                           # Set to 10 for quick testing (10x faster)

# Correlation threshold (line ~55)
CORRELATION_THRESHOLD = 0.6  # Default: 0.6 (high correlation, tight sectors)
                             # Produces 30-54 clusters per day
                             # Higher = fewer/smaller clusters
                             # Lower = larger/mega-clusters
                             # Top 20 cluster groups shown with [size=X] indicators
```

**Expected Runtimes (100 stocks, 2 years, SKIP_10DAY=True):**
- `sp500_rolling_correlation.py`: ~10-12 minutes (visualizations skipped)
- `extract_clusters_corr.py`: ~2-3 minutes
- `extract_clusters_jaccard.py`: ~12-15 minutes
- **Total pipeline**: ~25-30 minutes

**Fast Testing Mode (DATE_SAMPLING=10):**
- `extract_clusters_corr.py`: ~15-20 seconds
- `extract_clusters_jaccard.py`: ~1-2 minutes

## Current Implementation Status

**✅ Completed (Section 2.2 from paper):**
- Rolling correlation computation (10/30/50-day windows)
- **Method 1: Basic correlation threshold clustering** (`extract_clusters_corr.py`)
  - MST construction using distance metric: `d_ij = sqrt(2 * (1 - corr_ij))`
  - Edge filtering by correlation threshold (δ = 0.6)
  - Cluster extraction via connected components
- **Method 2: Jaccard distance + hierarchical clustering** (`extract_clusters_jaccard.py`)
  - Jaccard distance: `d(A,B) = 1 - |G_A ∩ G_B| / |G_A ∪ G_B|`
  - Hierarchical clustering (agglomerative, average linkage, mid-level cut)
  - Singleton clusters merged into 'outliers' group
- Daily cluster assignments exported (~500 days per window) for both methods
- Top 20 most frequent cluster groups shown with size indicators

**🚧 Next Steps (Future Enhancements):**

1. **Alternative Clustering Methods (section 2.2 of paper)**
   - Try different linkage methods (knn, single, ward, etc)
   - Experiment with different dendrogram cut strategies
   - Compare clustering quality metrics across methods

2. **Cluster Stability Analysis**
   - Track how cluster composition changes over time
   - Identify persistent vs. transient themes
   - Measure cluster lifetime and transitions
   - Compare stability between correlation vs. Jaccard methods

3. **Time Series Distance Metrics (Section 2.3)**
   - Implement alternative distance measures beyond correlation
   - DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) for non-linear alignment
   - Compare clustering results across distance metrics

4. **Portfolio Applications**
   - Theme-based portfolio construction from clusters
   - Backtest cluster rotation strategies
   - Risk analysis using cluster stability metrics

**Output Interpretation:**
- **Heatmaps**: Red/blue = positive/negative correlation; arrow keys navigate windows
- **MST**: Thicker edges = stronger correlation; clusters = market themes/sectors
- **Cluster Files**: Each line = one trading day's cluster assignments
