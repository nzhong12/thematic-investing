================================================================================
INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

Clusters are formed based on Jaccard distance between correlation neighborhoods.
Two stocks are in same cluster if they have similar correlation patterns
(i.e., their neighborhoods G_A and G_B have high overlap).

This method is more robust than pairwise correlations because:
  • Captures higher-order relationships
  • Less sensitive to individual correlation noise
  • Groups stocks with similar correlation structures
